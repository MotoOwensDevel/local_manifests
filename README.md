# local_manifests

This here is the manifest you'll want to use to sync all the owens stuff.  Put it in /[ROM FOLDER]/.repo/local_manifests/
and it should work the next time you go to do a repo sync.  This is built to spec for Lineage 14.1 (obviously), but with a
few minor alterations I don't see any reason why this won't work when building other ROMs too.
